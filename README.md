# MediCare+

MediCare+ is a frontend web application designed to help users manage daily medicines through a clean dashboard, reliable in-app reminders, and adherence analytics.  
The project focuses on **user experience, time-based logic, and realistic web constraints**, rather than only feature count.

🔗 GitHub Repository: <add-your-github-link-here>

## 📌 Features

- User authentication flow (login & signup)
- Dashboard-based UI for better clarity
- Add, edit, and delete medicines
- Time-based medicine tracking (Upcoming & Missed)
- **In-app reminder popup system** for reliable alerts
- Analytics page to track adherence insights
- Persistent data using Local Storage
- Protected routes with client-side routing
- Clean and responsive UI

---

## 🧠 Key Learning & Design Decisions

- Browser notifications are optional and OS-dependent, so the app relies primarily on **in-app reminder popups** for reliability.
- Features are separated using routes (Dashboard & Analytics) instead of placing everything on a single page.
- Focused on **product thinking**, edge cases, and real-world usability rather than overengineering.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Vite** (Build Tool)
- **React Router** (Client-side Routing)
- **Context API** (State Management)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Local Storage** (Client-side Persistence)
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Netlify** (Deployment)
